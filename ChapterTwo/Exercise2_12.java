/* 2.12 (Physics: finding runway length) Given an airplaneâ€™s acceleration a and take-off speed v, you can compute the
 * minimum runway length needed for an airplane to take off using the following formula:
 * length = v^2 / 2a
 * Write a program that prompts the user to enter v in meters/second (m/s) and the acceleration a in meters/second
 * squared (m/s ^ 2), and displays the minimum runway length. Here is a sample run:
 * Enter speed and acceleration: 60 3.5
 * The minimum runway length for this airplane is 514.286
